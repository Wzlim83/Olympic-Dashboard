ASEAN vs Top 3 Countries – Olympic Analysis
This data analytics project compares the Olympic performance of ASEAN countries against global leaders — the USA, Russia, and Germany. It explores trends in medal achievements, athlete physical attributes, and event participation to uncover performance gaps and surface strategic insights.

📊 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize how ASEAN countries perform in the Olympics relative to top-performing nations by evaluating:

🥇 Medal distribution across years and countries

📏 Athlete physical attributes (height, weight, age)

🏊 Event participation trends across disciplines

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning, wrangling, and transformation

Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data visualization

Dataset – Kaggle Olympic History Dataset (1896–2016)

📌 Key Insights

🔸 ASEAN countries show lower medal counts despite moderate participation levels.

🔸 ASEAN athletes are generally smaller in size (height, weight) compared to athletes from the top 3 countries. This pattern is consistent across top-participation events like athletics and swimming.

🔸 Lack of ASEAN participation in top sports (e.g., Ice Hockey) is likely due to geographical and climatic limitations. This presents opportunities to invest in infrastructure, such as indoor training facilities, to diversify competitive potential.
