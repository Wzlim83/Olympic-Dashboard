# 🏅 ASEAN vs Top 3 Countries – Olympic Analysis

This data analytics project compares the Olympic performance of **ASEAN countries** against global leaders — **USA**, **Russia**, and **Germany**. It explores trends in **medal achievements**, **athlete physical attributes**, and **event participation** to uncover performance gaps and surface strategic insights.

> ✅ *This project is part of my data analytics portfolio, demonstrating end-to-end analysis using Python and Power BI.*

## 📊 Project Objective

To analyse and visualise how ASEAN countries perform in the Olympics relative to top-performing nations by evaluating:

- 🥇 **Medal distribution** across time and countries  
- 📏 **Athlete physical attributes** – height, weight, and age  
- 🏊 **Event participation trends** across disciplines

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Explored and profiled data to understand structure and check for nulls  
- Standardized NOC codes (e.g., aligning Singapore codes across datasets)  
- Replaced `"NA"` values with `"Unknown"` for certain countries  
- Imputed missing values for **age**, **height**, and **weight**  
- Created new columns including a **medal tally** for better aggregation

## 📌 Key Insights

- 🔸 **ASEAN countries** have lower medal counts despite moderate participation  
- 🔸 ASEAN athletes tend to be **shorter and lighter**, especially in sports like athletics and swimming  
- 🔸 Limited ASEAN participation in **winter or high-equipment sports** (e.g., Ice Hockey) due to geographic/climatic constraints  
- 🔸 Investment in **training infrastructure** (e.g., indoor arenas) may help diversify ASEAN’s medal potential
