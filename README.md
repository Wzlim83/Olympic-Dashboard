ASEAN vs Top 3 Countries â€“ Olympic Analysis
This data analytics project compares the Olympic performance of ASEAN countries against global leaders â€” the USA, Russia, and Germany. It explores trends in participation, physical attributes, and medal achievements to identify performance gaps and highlight strategic insights.

ðŸ“Š Project Objective
To analyze how ASEAN countries perform in the Olympics compared to top-performing nations by evaluating:

Medal distribution across years and countries

Athlete physical attributes (height, weight, age)

Event participation trends

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python: Data cleaning and transformation 

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and data visualization

Kaggle Dataset: Olympic History Dataset (120 years)

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
ASEAN countries have lower medal counts despite moderate participation. 

ASEAN athletes are smaller in size as compared to the top 3 countries athletes. This is consistent throughout the top 5 sport and could explain why taller athletes dominate certain events like athletics(event specific) and swimming.

ASEAN has no participation in top 5 sports like Ice hockey, which is highly likely due to climate and geographical location. Opportunity for ASEAN to invest in facilities (for e.g indoor ice rink) to increase participation in under represented sports.
